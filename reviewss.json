You have to understand, you are getting what you pay for, you do not plan on doing anything crazy on this is iPad, or you want something for your child. This is a great product to buy them.

{"asin": "B09G9FPHY6", "text": "It's not just a purchase, It's an investment I should say. For a good price of 270$ you get a great tablet, with great battery, handful of polished software, and latest ipad OS.Evident Pros:The battery life is admirable. In my experience so far, it ocassionaly withstands 2 days before having 17-22% just before I recharge it. Worth to mention however, I don't use it for any mild-heavy gaming.The UI and the OS itself make the tablet a big win for art, study, and partially productivity work. It's very reliable.Nice responsive smooth screen. It's bright, colorful, and the panel is pretty qualitative, and what's important it's fairly repairable, so if you break the front glass it could be easily changed without the need to replace the whole screen.A13 processor. Let's not forget about that. Everything works smooth and fast from UI to the apps themselves.Shots to the overall quality of the product. It's very well-built what makes it feel like a more of a premium product for this money.Cons:The Camera unfortunately is only in the device for the sake of having a camera. If I wouldn't have to, I wouldn't take any photos on this thing. It's too unreliable.Have you seen the bezels of the screen? Having it's crazy specifications for its budget the front screen design makes it look like you bought a tablet from way back in 2016.Apple pen 1st gen. Seriously. Was it that hard to implement apple pen 2nd gen support? Come on apple, you don't even include the pen in the package.Absurd prices on accessories. I won't even care about these, since they cost more than a tablet itself lol", "title": "Best entry device for the apple ecosystem", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},
{"asin": "B09G9FPHY6", "text": "First of all, the BATTERY LIFE is Excellent!  BUT if you are Newbie, battery life will SUCK!  Why?Because you are newbie!  Understand battery life takes into consideration how many things are turned on  and how much juice you are currently using.  Let me give you an example.Your Home is POWERED by electricity,  and the more stuff you have turned on, TV, air conditionair, fans, refrig,  freezer, etc ... the higher your electric bill.  Are you with me so far?  With the IPAD, apple wanted to impress you with WOW factor when you got your IPAD, so it turns on tons of stuff, and has lots of stuff going in the background, using POWER.  YOU the USER will have to turn OFF the features you are NOT USING to increase how LONG the battery lasts.WIFI, Bluetooth, screen brightness, games and apps... going in the background, might NEED to be TURNED OFF if you don't need them at the moment.  ( example you don't need to turn on A.C. in your home in the middle of winter).... watch YouTube videos for tips and pointers on turning off/on only the features you need at the moment and learn all the cool things this device can do.I made this review when I read a number of posts of NEWBIE'S saying they got the IPAD and returned it because the battery life sucks.", "title": "great battery LIFE", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"}
